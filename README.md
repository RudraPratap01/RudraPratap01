# Hi, I'm Rudra Pratap....👋
I'm a first-year college student who’s just started his journey into tech. I'm always curious, eager to learn, and excited to build new things.

I’m currently exploring programming, development, and anything that helps me understand how technology really works.

🚀 What I'm doing right now:

   Learning the basics of coding

   Experimenting with small projects

   Trying to grow every day

💡 What I believe in:

  Start small, stay consistent

  Ask questions, stay curious

  Always be open to learning

📬 Feel free to connect or drop tips — I’m always up for learning something new!
